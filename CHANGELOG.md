# Trollolo Changelog

## Version 0.3.0

* Support for Ruby >= 2.2, including Ruby 2.5
* Add support for swimlanes, used for cards which are not part of the normal
  sprint.

## Version 0.2.0

* Require Ruby to be >= 2.2.0 and < 2.4.2 until #139 is fixed.
* `burndown-init` only requires the `--board-id` option. The `--output` option
  is optional and defaults to the current working directory. Fix #103.
* Allow to define checklists that should not be parsed as task lists. Such lists
  can be added in the trollolorc as `no_task_checklists`.
* Allow to provide a board id when calling `burndown`. Fix #100.
* Set the attached image as cover in `burndown --plot-to-board`. Fix #124.

## Version 0.1.1

* Fix the bug introduced whith always setting the burndown chart as the cover
  for `burndown --plot-to-board`, as it only worked with files in the current
  directory.

## Version 0.1.0

* Fix `plot-to-board` option in the burndown command when it is used together
  with `-o`.
* `burndown --plot-to-board` always sets the burndown chart as the cover.
  Fix #114.
* Allow to create and update an Sprint with a custom number. Fix #78.

## Version 0.0.14

* Add a new `plot-to-board` option to the burndown command to send the plotted
  burndown chart to the first card of the `Done` column.
* Add documentation for all CLI commands. Fixes #83.
* Allow to use `move-backlog` without waterline and seabed cards.
  Closes #106 and #107.

  `weekend_lines` params. Closes #77.
* Change stdout output when running set-priorities to render the new priority
  instead of the old one. Fixes #72.

## Version 0.0.10

* Rename `sprint-cleanup` to `cleanup-sprint`.
* Configure board, list and label names to trollolorc. The commands
  `cleanup-sprint`, `move-backlog`, `set-priorities` and `setup-scrum` will use
  these names. You will still need to provide board IDs, or their aliases, as
  several boards can share the same name.
* Add `setup-scrum` command to create all necessary elements of our scrumb board
  as configured in trollolorc or using the defaults. A sample configuration can
  be found in `spec/data/trollolorc`. Fixes #57
* Add option for backlog list name in `set-priorities`.
* Add `move-backlog` command for moving a backlog from a planning to a sprint board
* Handle boards which have an "Accepted" column in addition to a "Done" column

## Version 0.0.9

* Add `sprint-cleanup` command to move cards back from the sprint board to the
  planning board. It takes all cards from the "Sprint backlog" and "Doing"
  columns on the sprint board, moves them to the "Ready" column on the planning
  board and removes all members and the "under the waterline" label.
* Add `set-priorities` command to add priorities to the title of all cards of a
  given column. The priorities are added as a prefix of the form "Pnn", where
  "nn" is the number of the card in the column. This is useful, if you use the
  order of cards as priorities and want to move them around to different columns
  without losing this information.
* Consistently use hyphens in command names, get rid of underscores.
* Fix calculation of unplanned tasks on day one
* Fix scaling tasks

## Version 0.0.8

* Burndown chart reflects unplanned work

  If unplanned work is added to the board during the sprint, separate graphs
  for the corresponding story points and tasks are drawn. For easier
  distinction, the additional graphs got different colors and are mentioned in
  the also newly added legend of the plot.

* Implement `set-cover` command. This command uploads a picture to a given card,
  which is then set as cover.
* Fix raw output of cards list
* Fix commands to get basic data
* Don't overwrite data on first day of sprint

## Version 0.0.5

  one is taken for burndown calculations.

    * The command `list_backups` shows the list of backups which have been made
    * The backups are stored to the directory `~/.trollolo/backups` in JSON
      format
